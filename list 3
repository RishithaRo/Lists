# Python list methods are built in methods used to perform operations on python lists
# Syntax:- variable.method(parameters)
# Python append method
# It is mainly used to add an element to the end of the list.
list=[2,3,4,5]
a=list.append(6)
print(a)
''' Here, you will get the output as none . The reason you are getting none as the output is that the append() method in python does not return any value; It just modifies the list in place
Therefore, the value of a is none'''
